NREL Materials Database

The NREL MatDB is a central part of the search for more efficient
photovoltaic materials by the NREL Computational Materials
Science Team. The overall goal is the discovery of better
photovoltaic materials through a combination of theory, computer
modeling, and physical experiments.
