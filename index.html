  <h1> NREL Materials Database </h1>

The NREL MatDB is a central part of the search for more
efficient photovoltaic materials by the NREL Computational
Materials Science Team.
The overall goal is the discovery of better photovoltaic
materials through a combination
of theory, computer modeling, and physical experiments.

<p/>
The primary authors of the NREL MatDB are Peter Graf, Vladan Stevanovich,
and Stephen Sullivan, all of NREL.
Stephan Lany and Bill Tumas provide direction and oversight.
